====================================================

Author: Joel Pettersson <joelpet [at] kth [dot] se>


Project structure
-----------------

- benchmarks/
  - contains benchmarking data for the linear and speedup plots
- code/
  - benchmarking/
    - scripts for benchmarking the applications
  - particles/
    - the actual implementations of the particle simulator, incl. GridHashSet
  - plotting/
    - GNU Plot scripts that generates the plots for the benchmarks
  - visualize/
    - the provided utility for visualization of the generated simulations
- report/
  - report files


Building and running
--------------------

To build all implementations, simply enter the *particles* directory and run
`make`. For all implementations except MPI, simply run the generated binaries,
e.g. `./pthread`. The MPI implementation has to be run using `mpiexec` or any
of its equivalents.
